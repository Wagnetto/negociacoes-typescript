# Typescript lessons

This project is made on Typescript to practice the uses of Object Oriented paradigm, Interfaces and Decorators 
on this language that brings the safety os types for those who, as I, think Javascript has some "funny" issues.
Also was an interesting way to work with TS without any framework attached.

## What is this?

It's a form that inputs trading registers, and also imports some tradings already given, from a simple API. 

It checks if a trading register is already there, and if it's done on a business day too, displaying messages on error and success case.
